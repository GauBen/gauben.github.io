    Hey! I'm Gautier Ben Aïm, a 21-year-old French software developer.
    I'm currently learning Computer science at ENSEEIHT, France, and I wish to major in Software architecture and
    Cyber security.
  - >
    I discovered programming over ten years ago, and I haven't stopped since then. In parallel to my studies, I
    learned front and back-end development, and in engineering school I learned compiled client programming.
  - >
    I had the opportunity to work in many projects of various sizes – from a couple of people I met in real life
    to small contributions to worldwide projects with hundreds of other contributors. My friends say I'm
    spontaneous, ambitious and reliable. I enjoy teamwork, learning new technologies and keeping an eye on
    programming trends.

    At least, I hope so. I've been climbing for about 8 years by now, both indoors and outdoors, and it's probably the
    best sport when it comes to trusting yourself. And I was quite good at table tennis in high school.
